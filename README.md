# 3DGS-CD
3D Gaussian Splatting-based Change Detection for Physical Object Rearrangement

TLDR: We estimate **3D object-level changes** from two sets of unaligned RGB images using **3D Gaussian Splatting** as the scene representation, enabling **accurate** recovery of shapes and pose changes of rearranged objects in **cluttered environments** within **tens of seconds** using **sparse (as few as one) new images**.


Our code and data will be released soon!
